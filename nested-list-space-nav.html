       Now, create a nested list for a hypothetical dropdown menu on a website about stuff in the solar system (the indent shows you the dropdown topics for each of the main menu topics). Turn off the bullet display with CSS, since navigation doesn't use it. Also, you'll need to create hyperlinks inside each of the list items so that the menu is clickable. There is nowhere for the link to go (this is all a pretend menu), so use an empty href attribute: <li><a href="">linked text</a></li>. Also remember that nested lists go inside the parent list item.
